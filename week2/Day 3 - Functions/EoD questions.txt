What is the purpose of a function
	To be able to reuse blocks of code over and over again without having to re-write it

whats the difference betwee return and console.log?
	return will allow you to use the function to evaluate something later on. it allows you to store what the function 	evaluates to a variable

	console.log just prints to the console and doesnt do anything else. 

when writing a function whats the name of the item that gets placed in between the paranthesis?
	parameter


what does invoking a function refer to?
	running the function


what are the four parts to a function
	the function keyword
	the name of the function
	the function parameters
	the body of the function /block of code

---------------------------------------------------------------

function printName(name) {
  console.log(name)
}

let answer = doSomethingElse('Riley')

what would i expect to see if i console.log(answer)?
	undefined


how can we change the above function so that the console.log(answer) prints the name that was passed in?
	change console.log(name) to 'return name'


--------------------------------------------------------------

let age = 21

	function printAge(age){
	  console.log(age)
	}

printAge()

what should we expect to see printed in the console after running the above function
	undefined


why?

because the age parameter of the function overrode the declared age variable and nothing was passed in when we invoked the function


2 ways to fix it, what are they?
	1. remove the age parameter
	2. pass in age when you invoked the function



--------------------------------------------------------------


let age = 21

function doSomething(){
   let alphbet = abc
   console.log(age)
}

console.log(alphabet)


What can i expect to see in the console for the console.log(age)
	21
what can i expect to see in the console for the console.log(alphabet)
	undefined
