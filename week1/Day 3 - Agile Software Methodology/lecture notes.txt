	THE AGILE MANIFESTO
	- Individuals and interactions: focuses on the team and caters to their strengths (AKA Collaboration)
	
	
	
	AGILE PRINCIPLES
	- Deliver Frequently: SPRINTS (1-2 weeks) where you work on a specific portion of the app
	
	
	
	AGILE ACTIVITIES
	- Planning Poker: Everyone looks at a feature and suggests how long it will take for that feature to be completed
					Then the outliers are evaluated to see why they thought it would be very short or very long
					The discussion ensues, and when it is over, they vote again.
					this keeps happening until either everyone settles on a time frame that they think is suitable, or if no progress is being made
					
	MAKE "USER STORIES"
	- very similar to user persona, gives you a tangible example of what a feature might look like rather than a person
	
	
	ANATOMY OF A USER STORY
	- As a <Spotify User>, I want to <be able to find local bands> so that <i can support them>
	
	
	PLANNING POKER
	- After page is fully loaded




	DEMO
	- Take 5 minutes to draw an elephant 
		- share what they have drawn
	- Now take 1 minute to draw the outline of a lion (front facing)
		- share what they have drawn so far
	- Now spend about a 1 filling in some detail on the lions face (whiskers, mane, etc.)
	- Now draw two more lionesses, because they always travel in a pack
		- Now lets see the drawings again
	
	5 minute elephant had all sorts of different ideas on what that should look like
	
	vs 
	
	1 minute sprints, we all basically had the same image
	
	
	
	
	
	NEXT PART:
	
	PLANNING POKER
	
	Question: How long will it take to make breakfast consisting of Eggs, Bacon, Waffles, Orange Juice
	
	in chat vote for how long you think this will take to prepare, dont worry about your reasoning for now
	
	talk about the outliers, why did you pick the time you picked?
	
	
	Question: How long will it take to paint a two story house
	
	
	show that its better to be upfront about how long it will take
	
	the point here is to get as an accurate estimate on time its going to take to complete a task
